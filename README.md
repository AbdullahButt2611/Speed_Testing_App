  Web Application

<br><br>

<p align="justify">
The speed testing app is a web-based application that is designed to test a user's typing speed and accuracy. The app will provide the user with a paragraph to type, and the user will be informed of which letter to type next. The user will have 60 seconds to complete the task, and any wrong characters will be highlighted, allowing the user to go back and correct their mistakes.
One of the main features of this application is the ability to change the paragraph. The user can select from a list of paragraphs or input their own. This allows the user to practice typing on a topic that is relevant or interesting to them.
<br><br>
The application will also display the user's WPM (words per minute) and CPM (characters per minute). The WPM will provide an overall measure of the user's typing speed, while the CPM will only count the correct characters typed.
In addition, the app will provide the user with a visual representation of their progress, allowing them to see how their typing speed and accuracy improve over time.
<br><br>
To get started, the user can simply open the application in their web browser and select a paragraph to type. The app will then guide them through the typing test, and at the end, provide them with their WPM and CPM. The user can then review their mistakes and practice further to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
